### **ðŸ“Œ Overview**  
This project focuses on **Crime Data Analysis**, utilizing data science techniques to uncover crime patterns, trends, and risk factors. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis, we aim to provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policymakers. Key aspects include:  

- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding crime distributions through statistical analysis.  
- **Geospatial & Temporal Analysis**: Identifying crime hotspots and time-based trends.  
- **Visualization**: Using graphs, heatmaps, and time-series plots for better insights.  
- **Predictive Insights**: Analyzing correlations to aid crime prevention strategies.  

This project enables data-driven decision-making to enhance public safety and crime reduction efforts. ðŸš”ðŸ“Š
